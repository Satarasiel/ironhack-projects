## Project Description

In this project, you will choose a topic and find all the relevant data yourself from Kaggle.
Afterwards, you should enrich it by connecting to an API, find a dataset or scrape data from the web.
You then must organize, clean and analyse the data you find and present your findings in a presentation (you may use plots!).

<a name="project-goals"></a>

## Project Goals

- Learn how to develop an interesting question and find the data to answer it.
- Learn how to obtain data from different sources, including APIs, open source datasets and/or scrape data from the web.
- Build a database from the data you find for the whole team to use.
- Explain more complex arguments with plots.

<a name="requirements"></a>

## Requirements

- You must plan your project. That is why creating a Kanban or Trello Board is mandatory. You have a template for Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/26Wr3pVF/project-3-data-thief).
- You **CAN'T CODE** until you project is planned.
- Create a _.gitignore_ file and include it in your repository.
- Your project must include data from (at least) 2 different data sources (APIs & web, dataset & APIs, ...)

<a name="deliverables"></a>

## Deliverables

You are required to turn in the following:

1. Link to your profile on Kaggle.
2. Link to your GitHub Repository and README.
3. Documentation as talked about in class.
4. Access information to your database with a description of each table and how they relate.
5. Links to the data you are using (sources) and your organization (trello).
6. Slides for your presentation.

<a name="mentoring"></a>

## Mentoring

Either a TA or the Lead Teacher will be your mentor!
Your mentor will:

- Follow your project in general, will be the second person that knows more about the project, after you.
- Check if you are following the tasks, your blockers, etc
- Help/support you in specific questions.

Your mentor is NOT meant to:

- Know everything.
- Be your manager. You have to be the responsible person to do the tasks!

<a name="schedule"></a>

## README File structure

The README will be your paper and it is meant to have all the (analysis) information about your project.

The structure should be:

1. Title of the project
2. Introduction to your project.
3. Data you are using (and comments, main challenges, strengths & weaknesses, etc...)
4. Questions you want to answer (maybe divided by different topics). Each question should include a conclusion written in a markdown cell.
5. Conclusions after your analysis.
6. Further questions.

<a name="presentation"></a>

## Presentation

You will have 10 minutes to present your project. The below are some ideas for slides you could include in your presentation; those marked with an **(M)** are mandatory!

- **(M)** Title of the project
- **(M)** Your topic. Why did you choose it?
- **(M)** Presentation of the team
- Main challenges & strengths
- **(M)** Team. Did you follow your workflow plan? Did you add something after starting the project? Did you follow your best practices agreements? Did you think about the risk management?
- About your data: useful sources, incomplete data, data that would have been great to have, etc.
- Data cleaning: how and why you cleaned your data the way you did.
- **(M)** Main insights: one slide per insight!
- Questions you couldn't answer.
- Something funny that happened during the project.
- Things you learned during this project.
- If you could start from scratch, what would you do differently?

<a name="tips-&-tricks"></a>

## Tips & Tricks

- First, choose your topic and look for sources available.
- Before you start coding and integrate more data, propose some interesting questions you could answer with the data you have.
