## Project Description
**Goal**: doing a deep dive into the anime world and getting to know the average viewer and their viewing habits, to then better advise production studios in future content-making.

**Approach**: lots of data cleaning, processing, manipulation and exploratory data analysis with Pandas & Matplotlib, to be able to extract and visualize all the information I needed to draw my conclusions.

**Challenges**: turning data insights into action. Making sense of all this user data and how to turn it into useful recommendations for the production studios and decision makers.
