## Project Description
In this project, you will think of a topic, find the data, complete an end-to-end analysis and present the data in multiple ways, all by yourself. First, choose a topic of interest to you and understand what research has already been done in that area. What are some interesting questions that remain? You will then find some data you think could help answer those questions and complete an analysis with relevant visualizations. Last, you will present your findings both in a presentation and a report. 

<a name="project-goals"></a>

## Project Goals
* Research and analyse data on a topic of interest to you.
* Feel free to use additional data to enrich your dataset, maybe using SQL or web scraping.
* Apply the statistical techniques we have learned, along with techniques from EDA. 
* Create useful and easily-interpretable plots.
* Prepare a presentation keeping in mind the finer points of storytelling. 
* Communicate the results of your analysis clearly, accurately and engagingly. 

<a name="requirements"></a>

## Requirements  
* You must plan your project. That is why creating a Kanban or Trello Board is mandatory. You have a template for Trello [here](https://trello.com/b/YX8EsB2P/project-4-your-own-project).
* You **CAN'T CODE** until you project is planned.
* Create a *.gitignore* file and include it in your repository. 

<a name="deliverables"></a>

## Deliverables
* All the scripts you used for your analysis.
* Slides and a 5 minute presentation in the classroom.
* Repository with your workflow + documentation + code. Even if you are working alone, you need to maintain good practices!
* A short report including your motivation, methodology and results.

## Mentoring
One of the TAs will be your mentor!
Your mentor will:
* Follow your project in general.
* Check if you are following the tasks, your blockers, etc
* Help/support you in specific questions.

## Presentation  
Presentations for this project will be in the classroom! Presentations will be **EXACTLY** 5 minutes long, with 2 additional minutes for questions. We will stop you!  

<a name="tips-&-tricks"></a>

## Tips & Tricks
* Organize yourself (don't get lost!).
* Ask for help vs Google is your friend.
* Define a simple approach first. You never know how the data can betray you ;)
* Learn about your subject and understand what other research has been done before you.
* You *can* use data from the projects your partners did in the last weeks. You can't use your own project.
* Before making a graph, think about what you want to represent.
